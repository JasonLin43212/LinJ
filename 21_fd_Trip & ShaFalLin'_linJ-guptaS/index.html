    <h3>How To Get Foundation</h3>
    <p>
      To get Foundation, please go to this link to download it. Then, extract the
      zip file and copy the "foundation.min.css" file to where your project lives.
      In the &lt;head&gt; tag in your HTML file, insert the following:
      <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="path_to_foundation.min.css"&gt;</code>
      <br>However, we reccommend that you use the CDN

    <h2>How To Use Grids and Cells</h2>
    In order to divide your website into sections, you need to use the &lt;div&gt;
    tags to define sections of your website. To define a section that you want to
    split up, you set the class equal to <code>grid-x</code>. Now, for the &lt;div&gt;
    's that are inside the div with class <code>grid-x</code>, we can set the class
    equal to <code>cell</code>. Here is how the code looks like:<br><br>
    <textarea rows="6" cols="80" readonly>
      <div class="grid-x">
        <div class="red-div cell">This is a cell.</div>
        <div class="green-div cell">This is another cell.</div>
        <div class="blue-div cell">This is a third cell.</div>
      </div>
    </textarea>
    How It Looks Like:
    <div class="grid-x">
      <div class="red-div cell">This is a cell.</div>
      <div class="green-div cell">This is another cell.</div>
      <div class="blue-div cell">This is a third cell.</div>
    </div><br>
    Now what if you want to divide each of the cells into smaller sections. Well,
    you can! The format for this is [screen_size]-[number between 1-12]. This means
    that for a certain screen size (small, medium, large), the cell will take up
    [number between 1-12] out of 12 spaces. Let's look at an example:<br>
    <textarea rows="6" cols="80" readonly>
      <div class="grid-x">
        <div class="red-div cell small-4 medium-5 large-7">This is a cell.</div>
        <div class="green-div cell small-4 medium-5 large-4">This is another cell.</div>
        <div class="blue-div cell small-4 medium-2 large-1">This is a third cell.</div>
      </div>
    </textarea>
    How It Looks Like:
    <div class="grid-x">
      <div class="red-div cell small-4 medium-5 large-7">This is a cell.</div>
      <div class="green-div cell small-4 medium-5 large-4">This is another cell.</div>
      <div class="blue-div cell small-4 medium-2 large-1">This is a third cell.</div>
    </div><br>
    Try resizing this window. You will see that if the window is small, the cells will be
    in a 4:4:4 ratio. When the window is medium, it is in a 5:5:2 ratio, and when
    the window is large, it is in a 7:4:1 ratio. Note: if the ratios for a particular
    "row" add up to over 12, then the last cell that makes the total over 12 will
    go on the next row.<br><br>
    Overflow:
    <textarea rows="6" cols="80" readonly>
      <div class="grid-x">
        <div class="red-div cell small-6 medium-5 large-10 ">They all overflow in large.</div>
        <div class="green-div cell small-10 medium-5 large-10">This is overflowing in small.</div>
        <div class="blue-div cell small-2 medium-4 large-9">This is overflowing in medium.</div>
      </div>
    </textarea>
    How It Looks Like:
    <div class="grid-x">
      <div class="red-div cell small-6 medium-5 large-10 ">They all overflow in large.</div>
      <div class="green-div cell small-10 medium-5 large-10">This is overflowing in small.</div>
      <div class="blue-div cell small-2 medium-4 large-9">This is overflowing in medium.</div>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    Alright, now let's add some padding and margins to each cell. To add margins
    or padding, simply put <code>grid-margin-x</code> or <code>grid-padding-x</code>
    as another class for the div that has the class of <code>grid-x</code>.<br><br>
    Padding:
    <textarea rows="6" cols="80" readonly>
      <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
        <div class="red-div cell small-4">This is a cell.</div>
        <div class="green-div cell small-4">This is another cell.</div>
        <div class="blue-div cell small-4">This is a third cell.</div>
      </div>
    </textarea>
    <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
      <div class="red-div cell small-4">This is a cell.</div>
      <div class="green-div cell small-4">This is another cell.</div>
      <div class="blue-div cell small-4">This is a third cell.</div>
    </div>
    Notice how the text is indented to the right a little bit. That is the padding that
    is inside of each cell. Now let's see how the margin looks like.<br><br>
    Margins:
    <textarea rows="6" cols="80" readonly>
      <div class="grid-x grid-margin-x">
        <div class="red-div cell small-4">This is a cell.</div>
        <div class="green-div cell small-4">This is another cell.</div>
        <div class="blue-div cell small-4">This is a third cell.</div>
      </div>
    </textarea>
    <div class="grid-x grid-margin-x">
      <div class="red-div cell small-4">This is a cell.</div>
      <div class="green-div cell small-4">This is another cell.</div>
      <div class="blue-div cell small-4">This is a third cell.</div>
    </div><br>
    Notice how the margins are outside of the cells instead of inside? There is
    no indent inside of the cells.
    <br><br>
    You can also use the <code>shrink</code> to make the cell take up whatever it needs
    or <code>auto</code> to take up what is remaining. You can pair these with screen
    size in the following way <code>[screen_size]-auto</code> or <code>[screen_size]
    -shrink</code> to make it have this behavior under certain conditions.<br>
    Auto:
    <textarea rows="6" cols="80" readonly>
      <div class="grid-x grid-margin-x">
        <div class="red-div cell small-4 medium-7 large-9">This is a cell.</div>
        <div class="green-div cell auto">This is an auto cell.</div>
        <div class="blue-div cell small-5 medium-auto large-2">This is a medium auto cell.</div>
      </div>
    </textarea>
    <div class="grid-x grid-margin-x">
      <div class="red-div cell small-4 medium-7 large-9">This is a cell.</div>
      <div class="green-div cell auto">This is an auto for all sizes cell.</div>
      <div class="blue-div cell small-5 medium-auto large-2">This is a medium auto cell.</div>
    </div>
